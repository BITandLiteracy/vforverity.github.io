It was 4 a.m. in Davos. I was still wake preparing for the three interviews that I’m going to do after 5 hours. I knew I need some sleep but the list of question is not good enough...

It dawn on me that there has to be a solution to situation like this. Why I’m always not ready when I have the opportunity to talk to someone amazing? As a reporter, what is the basic formula to create a conversation that worth the time? What are the fundamental questions in a industry?

This year, I am going to study and create a profile for the following lists.

> A. [Fortune 100 Companies](http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/list)
>
> B. [Forbes The World’s Most Powerful People](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/)
>
> C. [Leaders of G20 Countries](https://www.g20.org/Webs/G20/EN/G20/Participants/participants_node.html;jsessionid=4FB35D6BB0180525177C95C1EABF5C2B.s5t1)
>
> D. [The list for Unicorns](http://fortune.com/unicorns/)

Ok, that sounds like a lot of work. But the good thing about working for a mainstream TV network is that I might actually have the chance to meet and talk to those people. So I’m super excited!

But how should I structure the profile? I could start with the published books and articles, news and interviews, social network, my previous interaction with that person or company… That is a pattern I’m trying to understand by the end of this year. So I really love to hear your comments.

> A little bit about me. I’m Vanessa working as a TV reporter specialized in business and tech news. I went to college at the age of 15, majored in Econ, Law and go-kart. I’ve been working for my current TV network for 5 years as reporter, editor and documentary film director. I believe creating an interview is like design a building, it should be functional and stylish.
